This is the story of Tim Ostler. When Tim came crashing to the flat bottom of the halfpipe he instantly realized something was wrong; he could not move. His body was twisted, not sitting right and what he did not know was his spinal cord was partially severed. In that moment he did know he would never snowboard again.\r\n\r\nAs most people would spiral into a pit of despair and depression Tim took a different approach. Life in a chair was not going to be a death sentence. Instead he was going to be positive and take each challenge as they came and deal with this head on. His high school sweetheart Kellie was by his side and with a love as strong as theirs they were going to get through this together. Tim teaches us the most important thing in life is the people you surround yourself with; from friends to family, it’s all about your relationships.\r\n\r\nAs Tim adjusts to life in a chair he sees the love from the snowboard community at a whole new level as they rally to do everything they can to help him adjust. He fills the desire to stay active by finding a new passion in a sport called wheel chair rugby aka Murder ball. He marries the love of his life and comes to the conclusion that he is pretty damn good at life in a chair. Tim shows us how you handle these situations in life is what shapes you and makes you who you are. Let’s navigate Tim’s Bomb Holes and maybe after hearing this story re-evaluate the problems that we all face. Maybe they just aren’t that bad and maybe if we learn from Tim we can get through them and live our lives to the fullest.","VideoUrl":"x9HKLBHVrFQ","DatePosted":"2020-05-22T00:00:00"},{"Id":11,"Category":"Snowboard","ImageUrl":"https://i0.wp.com/www.snowboarder.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Jamiethumb.jpg?resize=300%2C169&ssl=1","Title":"FRESH & TRACKED: JAMIE ANDERSON ON RIDER'S MEETINGS, SCAFFOLDING JUMPS, 5G, AND MORE!","Description":"Light some candles, bust out the defuser, and get into your most comfortable yoga position as Jamie Anderson offers her opinion on quarantining in Canada, scaffolding jumps, rider’s meetings and a laundry list of other holistic topics.\r\n\r\nBorn and raised on the slopes of South Lake Tahoe, Jamie Anderson has been a tour de force on a snowboard nearly from the time she first strapped in at age nine. Since her debut in the X Games in 2004, she has earned an unprecedented seventeen medals, including six golds, the latter which is the most of any athlete, male or female, in one discipline. Her cache of awards is one of snowboarding’s most impressive, with US Open wins, TTR championships, multiple Ride of the Year accolades, and Olympic gold and silver. But the proof of her talent and tenacity isn’t merely in her podium finishes but in the way she is constantly pushing herself, both in terms of tricks and terrain, and the uncommon influence that continues to have on her peers and up-and-coming riders. While double corks are a mainstay of her repertoire, in the past few seasons she has tackled backcountry booters and Alaskan lines in between contests, a balancing act that Jamie has excelled at, providing a glimpse of what she’s capable of in the off piste. Coming off the success of her 2019 movie, Unconditional; earning the 2020 Women’s Rider of the Year in February; and another first place finish at the 2020 Burton US Open Snowboarding Championships in early March, Jamie caught up with SNOWBOARDER for this edition of Fresh & Tracked, check it out above!","VideoUrl":"wcAz0gaA6ko","DatePosted":"2020-05-22T00:00:00"},{"Id":12,"Category":"Snowboard","ImageUrl":"https://i0.wp.com/www.snowboarder.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ethan.jpg?resize=300%2C169&ssl=1","Title":"WE TRIPPY REMIX—ETHAN MORGAN B ROLL PART","Description":"Things feeling a little cramped at home?

The video garnered a pretty good amount of positive attention but it also drew ire from several individuals within the media condemning Josh and Rob’s actions. Their disgust was pretty comical and it made for quite the entertaining satirical replays within our blading community.\r\n\r\nWell now Josh Nielsen & Rob Kellett have returned with their full-fledged new video titled “Neon Inline“, which was filmed before the COVID-19 pandemic. Sadly, their time in Wuhan was cut short due to the coronavirus, but they were still able to make this beautifully filmed and edited piece with the footage they were able to collect.\r\n\r\nThe video’s fresh and futuristic graphics gives us flashbacks reminiscent of sci-fi classics such as Blade Runner and Total Recall while the skating from the duo is equally impressive with both Josh and Rob displaying super clean style and uncanny technical abilities. We especially loved the Be-Mag and other sponsor’s logos thrown into the video as well! Nice touch, boys!\r\n\r\nEdited by Rob Kellett.

‘N’ DICE | VOLUME 5","Description":"The carving revolution continues with Slice ‘n’ Dice Volume 5. Like the last episode, the crew are based in Japan, though this time Niseko night sessions are switched for daylight carving in Hakuba, Happo Banks, where the ollie high, carve low story lives on.  Due to the not-so-ideal visibility during the crew’s visit to Happo Banks, it might be a little tricky tell why people are so stoked on this place. But Happo is a mecca for carving fans everywhere, and it looks like the Slice ‘n’ Dice boys had a great time of it anyway.  Riders: Dave Crozier, Real Snowboarding and Lewis Sonvico, SuperRad.  Film: Ed Blomfield & Sam McMachon. Edited: Sam McMahon.  Supported by Nidecker Snowboards.","VideoUrl":"mzEvJho2pMA","DatePosted":"0001-01-01T00:00:00"}]
